# Machine_Learning

Under this I analyzed 18 different datasets using Machine Learningâ€™s algorithms (mostly Classification algorithms) and prepared a final analysis file containing accuracy of each algorithm corresponding to different datasets . Finally I examined  the final analysis file to compare the different algorithms for different datasets. I used python programming language & jupyter Notebook software for the implementation .
